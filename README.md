## Introduction

Geoffrey is a fledgling developer with a great, business-worthy idea. One weekend, he sits down to get started. He decides to use Node because that's what all the cool developers are talking about, and Geoffrey feels confident with his JavaScript skills. He's set on making a Single-page App and maybe even a mobile app, and he knows that other developers will want to interact with the data he collects, so building an API seems like a natural choice. But Geoffrey's stuck on how to get started - he's overwhelmed. There's just so many tools. Which should he use? What does he even need? He agonizes about having to get everything set up and configured. That's going to take days, even weeks! He doesn't have time for this. All he wants is to is get his idea up-and-running so that he can focus on everything else like designing the user experience and getting customer feedback and validation. If only there was an easier way.

## About

Rubio aims to be a toolbelt for building Node web APIs. It's designed for people with business goals in mind who don't have the time right now to care about their underlying infrastructure but who will want finer control once things get going. It's designed as a learning tool for those who want to learn more about the components that go into building an API. And it's designed as an experimentation tool for those who don't know what tools they'll need and want the freedom to try things out without the fear of being locked into any one tool. Rubio holds your hand, but gets out of your way when you don't need the help anymore. For more, see `MANIFESTO.md`.

## Contributing

Building a great API toolbelt is quite an undertaking, and I'd be psyched if you want to help. I'm just getting started and design will take some time, but stick around and I'll let you know when your help is needed. If it's urgent, I'm [@billdybas](https://twitter.com/billdybas)
